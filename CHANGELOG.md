### 4.0.0 (2016-10-22)

Realizing that callbacks should pass `AnyObject?` instead of `Any?`, Iâ€™ve decided to roll back the previous change. However, this comes with the drawback of not allowing fragments in JSON HTTP bodies, but this is acceptable, a decent JSON API should not return unboxed primitives.
